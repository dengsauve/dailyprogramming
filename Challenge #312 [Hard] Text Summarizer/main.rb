# Challenge: Write an implementation of a text summarizer that can take a block of text (e.g. a paragraph),
# and emit a one or two sentence summarization of it.


# Read in Stop list
stop_file = File.open('stop.txt','r+')
stops = stop_file.readlines
stops.each do |line|
  
end


stop_file.close





# Read in paragraph.text




# score sentences initially at 0.0, and -1 point for every stop word.

# divide float score by sentence length

# Take the two highest scoring sentences.
